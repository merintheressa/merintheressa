### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Merin Mathew, and I am a QA Engineer currently working towards my goal of becoming a Front End Engineer. I am learning front-end development technologies, and I am excited to apply my skills in my first project, DevBoost.

Originally from Kerala, India, I am currently living in Stuttgart, Germany.
